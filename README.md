### What I learned

This is the first Frontend Mentor challenge that I have completed. I wanted to create a calculator to brush up on my JavaScript skills and see where I needed to improve, but I also really like that Frontend Mentor challeges you to create CSS from a style guide.

I started out by making the calculator using a series of functions but found that the code got quite long and repetitive. I had just used classes in a weather app so decided to try it the same way and see if it would simplify things. This project was a good opportunity to practice using the this keyword and switch statements which I don't make enough use of.

### Continued development

The CSS is not complete, I will update this soon.
I would like to recreate this without using classes and see if I can improve on my original approach. I would also like to add more advanced operations as this is quite a simple calculator.
